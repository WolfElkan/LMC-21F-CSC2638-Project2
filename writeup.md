# Project 2 Writeup

## In general, how useful is the Stack data structure? Can you think of other uses aside from those discussed in the applications chapter? 

See my answer to [CBA 1](https://landmark.instructure.com/courses/3993/assignments/97844/submissions/4514).

## If we didnâ€™t have the Stack data structure can you think of another way to implement the LIFO (last in first out) concept? 

I'm not sure I understand this question.  LIFO is what *defines* a stack.  So if we were to find a way to implement it using some other structure, that structure would become a stack.  

If you're asking whether there are multiple ways to implement LIFO using different underlying structures, then yes, see my initial submission to this project using a Linked List, rather than an Array.
