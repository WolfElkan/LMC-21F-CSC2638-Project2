## Stack Implementation (Ch. 6)

**Description:**

* Implement a Stack class using an **array** to contain entries. 
* Maintain the stacks’ **bottom entry** in `stack[stack.length – 1]`  (i.e., at the **end of the array**). 
* Start with an initial capacity and expand the array dynamically, as necessary.
* Make your class **generic** so it can hold any type.
