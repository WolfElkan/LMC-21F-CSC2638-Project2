## Stack Implementation (Ch. 6)

**Description:**

* Implement a Stack class using an **array** to contain entries. 
* Maintain the stacks’ **bottom entry** in `stack[stack.length – 1]`  (i.e., at the **end of the array**). 
* Start with an initial capacity and expand the array dynamically, as necessary.
* Make your class **generic** so it can hold any type. 

## Stack Application (Ch. 5)

A **palindrome** is a string of characters (a word, phrase, or sentence) that is the same regardless of whether you read it forward or backward – assuming you ignore spaces, punctuation, and case. For example, the following are Palindromes:
* Race car
* A man, a plan, a canal: Panama 
* Madam

Write a Java program that uses your stack to test whether an input string is a palindrome.
