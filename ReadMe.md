Hi Prof. Assiter,

Here is my submission for **Project 2: Palindrome Finder**.  As promised. I have updated it to use an Array Stack.  

To run the project:
1. Download or clone to your local device.
2. Unzip if necessary
3. Navigate into the project folder (Probably called `LMC-21F-CSC2638-Project2`)
4. Run `javac Palindrome.java` to compile the project.
5. Run `java Palindrome` to run the project.
6. Follow the prompts printed to the console.

This is meant to be intuitive enough to make a demonstration unncessesary.  However, if you have any questions, or would like me to demonstrate it anyway, I will be happy to do so.

Here is my [writeup](blob/master/writeup.md) of the project.

Thanks,

Wolf Elkan
